## 1) deepHaem model for DeepSEA dataset

* Model trained with the deepHaem implementation and architecture modifications.
* 5 Convolutional layers with ReLU and max pooling
* More pooling to reduce the size of the final fully connected layer.

## 2) deepHaem model using DeepSEA data compendium supplemented by erythroid data
* This is the model sued for transfer learning in [deepC](https://github.com/rschwess/deepC).
* Model trained with the deepHaem implementation and architecture modifications.
* 5 Convolutional layers with ReLU and max pooling
* More pooling to reduce the size of the final fully connected layer.
